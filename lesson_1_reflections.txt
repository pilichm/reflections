How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Using diff helps fint line including errors, because it only displays lines that differ in comparing files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

If i ever make a mistake i could easily find version of the file that doesn't contain this error.What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros:
Only saves when importatn change is made.
Limited number of commits.

Cons:
I have to remember to commit after major changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Cause some of them are designed for storing unrelated file while other are mainly used for storing code.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Locate versions I'm interested in with git log and compare them with git diff.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Knowing that I can always return to previous version encourages me to make changes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Coding!
