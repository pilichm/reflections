When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Keeping it remote makesi safer, since its harder to accidently delete from both local and remote repo.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So that automatic pull doesn't override my changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branches - cloning within one repo on local machine.
Forks - cloning repos inside github.
Clone - cloning repo from git to local machine or inside machine.
Branches - for testing and implementing new features.
Cloning - for downloading remote repos and moving repo inside my local machine.
Fork - for copying repos on github.
