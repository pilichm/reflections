When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Keeping it remote makesi safer, since its harder to accidently delete from both local and remote repo.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So that automatic pull doesn't override my changes.
