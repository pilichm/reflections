When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Keeping it remote makesi safer, since its harder to accidently delete from both local and remote repo.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So that automatic pull doesn't override my changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branches - cloning within one repo on local machine.
Forks - cloning repos inside github.
Clone - cloning repo from git to local machine or inside machine.
Branches - for testing and implementing new features.
Cloning - for downloading remote repos and moving repo inside my local machine.
Fork - for copying repos on github.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
To compare it with local changes.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
By sharing archives containing complete projects between colleagues.
Easier: No need to learn version controll.
Harder: Troules with keeping participants up to date and with merging changes made by multiple participants.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
When changes are big, for example when working on a new feature so that i don't break anything in master.
